**Common extraction ratios include:**
- 2:1 extracts (2 grams of leaf per 1 gram of extract)
- 5:1 extracts (5 grams of leaf per 1 gram of extract)
- 10:1 extracts (10 grams of leaf per 1 gram of extract)
- 50x standardized extracts (50% alkaloid content)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between kratom powder and kratom extract?

Kratom extract contains concentrated alkaloids from the kratom plant, making it significantly more potent than regular powder. While kratom powder typically contains 1-2% alkaloids, extracts can contain 10-50% or higher concentrations. This means much smaller doses are needed with extracts, and effects tend to be stronger and faster-acting.

### How do I determine the right kratom extract dosage for me?

Start with the smallest possible dose - typically 1/4 of what you might use with regular kratom powder. For liquid extracts, begin with 2-3 drops. For enhanced powders, start with 0.5 grams or less. Wait at least 45-60 minutes before considering additional dosing, as extracts can take longer to reach peak effects than regular kratom.

### Are kratom extracts legal to purchase online?

Kratom extract legality varies by location. While legal federally, several states have banned kratom entirely, and some cities have local restrictions. Always verify your local and state laws before purchasing. Additionally, some areas have age restrictions requiring buyers to be 18 or 21 years old.

### What should I look for in lab testing results for kratom extract?

Quality lab tests should show alkaloid content (especially mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine), heavy metals screening, microbiological testing for bacteria and mold, and pesticide residue analysis. Look for certificates of analysis (COAs) from third-party laboratories with batch-specific results and recent testing dates.

### How long does kratom extract stay potent when stored properly?

When stored in cool, dry, dark conditions in airtight containers, most kratom extracts maintain potency for 12-36 months. Liquid extracts typically have shorter shelf lives (12-18 months) and benefit from refrigeration, while properly stored resins and enhanced powders can maintain potency for 2-3 years.

### Why do kratom extract prices vary so much between vendors?

Price variations reflect differences in source material quality, extraction methods, testing protocols, packaging, and vendor overhead costs. Extremely low prices may indicate poor quality or lack of testing, while very high prices don't always guarantee superior products. Focus on value by comparing potency, testing, and customer reviews rather than price alone.

## Conclusion

Successfully purchasing high-quality kratom extract requires careful vendor research, understanding of potency levels, and attention to legal compliance. The most important factors include verifying third-party lab testing, choosing reputable vendors with transparent practices, and starting with conservative dosing due to the concentrated nature of these products.
